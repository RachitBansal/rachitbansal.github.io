This is your first blog post. You can edit or delete it and start writing your own.

**To add a new post:**

1. Create a new file in the `_posts` folder.
2. Name it with the date and a slug, e.g. `2026-02-08-my-paper-explained.md`.
3. Add this at the top (front matter):

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your post title"
date: 2026-02-08
---
```

4. Write your content below in Markdown. Use `excerpt: "A short summary"` in the front matter if you want a custom preview on the blog index.

You can link to your papers, add math with LaTeX, and use images—everything you’re used to from the rest of the site.
